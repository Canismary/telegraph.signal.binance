      <strong>What is good about the crypto?</strong>
      <p>
        You don't need a broker. You don't need to fill out a bunch of
        documents. You don't need to wait for the auction to open. You don't
        need to swear with banks and explain the meaning of bank transfers for
        the sake of 10% per annum.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the crypto market, experienced traders make such a profit in 5
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to the new world where you can trade 24/7!</p>
      <p class="cl1">
        Welcome to one of the most promising markets today - the cryptocurrency
        market.
      </p>
      <strong>Is it risky?</strong>
      <p>
        Crypto market grows or falls but it does not matter. It is important to
        correctly anticipate the movement, catch the trend and move along with
        the market.
      </p>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a chance to multiply your money many times.</p>
      <p>
        But we have to warn you: the risks here are outrageous. And only those
        who have the baggage of solid experience behind them are able to make
        money in such a market.
      </p>
      <p class="cl1">
        That is why we created our VIP channel where we share our signals which
        you can use and not to be afraid to lose money!
      </p>
      <strong>Where exactly do you trade?</strong>
      <p>We trade only Futures now. Our favourite exchange is Binance.</p>
      <p>
        The main thing in Futures is that you can use a leverage up to x125.
      </p>
      <img class="image" src="./Telegraph2.png" alt="" />
      <strong>What about your team and experience? </strong>
      <p>
        There are 5 people in our team now - analytics and traders. All of us
        started working on crypto market in 2015-2016 and we started trading
        futures since the day they were launched on the Binance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trends, channels, support and resistance zones, moving averages,
        Fibonacci levels, AZT, VSA (volume and spread analysis), Price Action,
        patterns and candlestick analysis, glass visualization and cluster
        analysis, long-short ratio, the Wyckoff method and a dozen other tools,
        sometimes very exotic - here is our a gentleman's set.
      </p>
      <p class="cl1">
        We have a trading system and strict compliance with the trading
        strategy, competently built risk management, money management, plan A,
        plan B and plan D (in case of total loss), a clear understanding of the
        assets used, the time spent in the trades, the reasons for opening a
        position, entry points, exit, etc.
      </p>
      <strong
        >With what trading deposit does it make sense to join your VIP
        channel?</strong
      >
      <p>The minimum recommended trading deposit size is $100-$200.</p>
      <p class="cl1">
        The average size of the trading deposit in our VIP channel is
        $1000-$5000.
      </p>
      <strong>What kind of profitability can i expect?!</strong>
      <p>A lot depends on the state of the market.</p>
      <p>
        We give 5-7 signals a day, the average possibility of these signals is
        75-80% (negative trades close with small loss).
      </p>
      <p class="cl1">
        As an average reference point for the year, you can take 700-1000% per
        month.
      </p>
      <strong>Do you have some feedbacks from your subscribers?</strong>
      <p>
        We post feedbacks from our VIP members in our public channel every day.
      </p>
      <img class="image" src="./Telegraph3.jpeg" alt="" />
      <strong>What is your strategy?</strong>
      <p>
        We strictly adhere to risk management and adhere to the trading
        strategy. Entry into a position, as a rule, is carried out by no more
        than 5-10% of the trading deposit.
      </p>
      <p class="cl1">
        We trade with tight stops. The probability of a complete loss of the
        trading deposit, if all the recommendations are followed, tends to zero.
        We trade swing, short-term and intraday.
      </p>
      <strong>Where can i trade?</strong>
      <p class="cl1">
        Just imagine, anywhere in the world you open a MacBook, log into your
        account on the stock exchange and get access to huge liquidity, from
        which you can take as much as you carry away.
      </p>

        >What can i do if Binance Futures is not allowed in my country?</strong

      <p>

        use.

      <strong>Will trading suit me?!</strong>
      <p>To find out the answer to this question - you need to try!</p>
      <p>
        People, in principle, do not understand what trading is, or treat it too
        naively, hoping to earn millions quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="cl1">
        You will have to make a lot of mistakes before you will be able to earn.
        <strong>Or you can join our team and get our signals.</strong> So, make
        a choiceü§©.
      </p>

      <strong>Have you had any losses?</strong>
      <p>
        Of course we had. We made mistakes and lost money. This is the market
        and this is the crypt, anything can happen here. But in the long run, we
        always remain in the black. Do you know why? Because we follow two main
        rules in trading:
      </p>
      <p>- cut losses</p>
      <p class="cl1">- let the profit grow</p>
      <strong>Will i understand your signals? How they look like?</strong>
